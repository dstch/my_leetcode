# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating c
# haracters. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a 
# substring.
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
# Input: s = ""
# Output: 0
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 
#  s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
